Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is.
You have to see it for yourself.
What you know you can't explain, but you feel it.
Youâ€™ve felt it your entire life.
That there's something wrong with the world.
You don't know what it is, but it's there.
Like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad.
It is this feeling that has brought you to me.
